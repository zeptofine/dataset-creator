# dataset-creator

This is a tool I made to assist making datasets for image models.

TODO:

- [x] make UI
- [x] redo config setup
- [ ] More filters
- [ ] bind UI to the CLI methods

Before the last point can be started, create_dataset.py must be broken down far enough such that almost all it is controlling is progress tracking.
